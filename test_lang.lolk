!-- This is a program written in my own language parsed and made with Python.

!-- The classic
show("Hello World!")

!-- Variable definitions and equations work too.
num = 200
y = (num + 50) / 2
!-- Unary minus operator also works.
z = 10 - -45 + 3 * 4 + -543 * (10 - 7) / 3 + -2
show("Z is equal to " + string(z) + "!")

!-- If statements (All comparisons)! For now though, only one line. (And string concatenation work!)
if num == 200 then show("The 'num' variable is equal to 200!") else show("No, the 'num' variable was equal to: " + string(num))
if y > 100 then show("Y is bigger than 100")
if z <= 0 then show("Z is lesser than or equal to 0")
!-- Won't run:
if z >= 10 then show("Z is bigger than or equal to 10")

!-- Remember when you concatenate strings together to convert the other datatypes to strings.
show("The variable y is equal to " + string(y))
!-- Concatenation can be performed with both + and ++
!-- This is useful for when you just want to append an integer after another int without calculating them.
show("Hello " ++ "World! " + "Hello...")
x = 10
y = 42
!-- This would give 52.
show(x+y)
!-- THIS however, would give 1042 (Because you just concatenate them together as string)
show(x++y)

!-- Now function definitions and input from user also works!
fun get_fav_col() --> 
    show("Hello")
    show("Multiple lines!")

!-- Call function.
