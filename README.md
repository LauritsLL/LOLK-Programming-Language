# LOLK

## Installation
This project depends on the `sly` library.
Install it with: `$ pip3 install sly`

Then you need to,
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/LauritsLL/LOLK-Programming-Language.git`
2. Run the `lang_interpreter.py` or the `lang_compiler.py` file, which depends on if you want to use the in-built interpreter or [compile](#use_compiler) a file.

## Use the in-built interpreter.
Run the file `lang_interpreter.py` and it will automatically enter the prompt, where you can type code.

## <a name="use_compiler"></a>Use the compiler
To compile your own files, run the `lang_compiler.py` file, and type in the path to your file. F.ex.:

`What file do you want to use (Starting in root directory {DIRECTORY}) test_lang.lolk`

This would run the interpreter on the `test_lang.lolk` file and display the output in real-time.
